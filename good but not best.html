<h1> A Brief History Of Astronomy </h1>
<br>
<p style="font-size: 20px">Countless generations have looked up at the night sky to observe its twinkling stars and dancing lights. In dark and remote places, before the advent of today's modern metropolises, the shimmering night sky must have looked truly alive.</p><br>
<br>
<p>Early days (and nights)</p><br>
<p>Indigenous cultures around the world have long performed astronomical observation with the naked eye, frequently spotting stars, planets, and other celestial phenomena.</p><br>

<p>These communities often used their knowledge of astronomy for:</p><br>
<ul>
<li>Navigation</li><br>
<li>Timekeeping</li><br>
<li>Spiritual and religious practices</li><br>
<li>A closer look at the heavens</li><br>
</ul>
<p>Ancient astronomers from around the world made many early observations and predictions. Historical records include many star charts, which reveal clear efforts to map the night sky and learn more about the mechanics of our universe.</p><br>

<p>Some examples of early discoveries include:</p><br>

<p>Planets versus stars</p><br>
<p>Babylonian astronomers in the first and second millennia BCE tracked five points of light in the night sky that moved differently than the other stars did. They concluded that something fundamentally different existed: these five points of light were not stars at all. Historians and astronomers now believe the Babylonians were among the first to recognize the planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, which become visible to the naked eye at different times of the year.</p><br>

<p>A spherical Earth</p><br>
<p>As early as the 6th century BCE, ancient Greek philosophers documented evidence that Earth was a sphere. They noted that the night sky looked different when seen from various locations on Earth, hinting at our planet's curved surface. They also observed the round shadow of Earth on the Moon during lunar eclipses. These philosophers were even able to calculate the circumference of Earth quite accurately. They did this by measuring the length of the shadow cast by an object at exactly the same time, in two different locations. Taking into account the distance between those two locations and the difference in the lengths of the shadows, they calculated that Earth's circumference was about 46,250 kilometres. That is very close to the real value of 40,075 kilometres!</p><br>

<p>Bright supernovae</p><br>
<p>In the year 185, Chinese astronomers became the first to document a supernova. Several supernova explosions have been observed since then, including a particularly bright one in the year 1054, which (at its peak) was four times brighter than planet Venus, one of the brightest objects in the night sky. Some supernovae are even bright enough to be visible during the day!</p><br>

<p>Cloudy galaxies</p><br>
<p>The notion that our own galaxy – the Milky Way – is but one of trillions of other galaxies in the universe only dates back about a century. Before then, nearby galaxies were thought to be cloudy regions of the Milky Way. The first documented observation of the neighbouring Andromeda Galaxy was in the year 964 by a Persian astronomer who described it as a "nebulous smear." For centuries, it was simply known in star charts as the "Little Cloud."</p><br>


<p>The astrolabe, such as this one developed in 1553 by French clockmaker Jean Naze, is a navigational tool that can determine local time and location in latitude based on the position of celestial objects. Although the Sun is most commonly used, a total of 58 recognized "navigational stars" can help calculate the user's location. One method of astronavigation even uses the angle of the Moon to calculate time, a key piece of information for pre-modern sailors travelling on unfamiliar seas. (Credit: Marie-Lan Nguyen)</p><br>

<p>The Copernican revolution</p><br>
<p>Before the 16th century, Earth was commonly thought to be at the centre of the solar system, with all other celestial objects revolving around it. This is known as the geocentric model. This theory, however, did not match some confusing observations made by astronomers, such as the path of planets that appeared to move backwards on their orbits.</p><br>


<p>When we observe, from Earth, the planets around the Sun, they do not always appear to be moving in one direction in our sky. Sometimes they appear to loop backwards for short periods of time. This is called retrograde motion and is one of the key pieces of evidence that the Sun lies at the centre of the solar system and all the planets revolve around it.</p><br>

<p>In 1543, Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus proposed a heliocentric model of the solar system in which the planets orbit the Sun. This model explained the unusual path of planets that astronomers had observed. The new theory was one of many revolutionary ideas about astronomy that emerged during the Renaissance period.</p><br>

<p>The work of astronomers Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler led to an accurate description of planetary motions and laid the foundation for Isaac Newton's theory of gravitation. This progress dramatically improved humanity's understanding of the universe. Their observations and investigations were strengthened by the invention of the telescope in the early 17th century. Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei popularized the use of telescopes to study and discover celestial objects, including Jupiter's four biggest moons. In his honour, they are known as the Galilean moons.</p><br>

<p>An expanding universe of knowledge</p><br>
<p>Over the following centuries, astronomers around the world formalized the study of the sky by creating detailed catalogues of stars, star clusters, and nebulae. After discovering Uranus in 1781, William Herschel opened new areas of research in 1800 by discovering infrared radiation – a type of light that is not visible to the human eye.</p><br>

<p>Others took advantage of rapid progress in the fields of optics and imaging. In 1923, Edwin Hubble fundamentally changed the scientific view of the universe when he used the 2.5 m-diameter Hooker telescope to prove that the Andromeda Nebula extends beyond our Milky Way Galaxy.</p><br>

<p>Hubble's discovery of the universe's ongoing expansion also paved the way for other astronomers to theorize its origin. The big bang theory, first proposed by Georges Lemaître, was later bolstered by strong evidence: the discovery of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), faint "noise" left over from the massive explosion that gave rise to everything in the universe. The CMB was accidentally discovered by radio astronomers just five years before the 1969 Apollo 11 Moon landing.</p><br>

<p>Improvements in satellite launch and design allowed astronomers to collect even more data about planets within our solar system in the second half of the 20th century. Several robotic space probe campaigns, including Mariner, Venera, and Voyager, ventured farther than ever before.</p><br>

<p>Astronomy today</p><br>

<p>Today, astronomers collect data about celestial objects by using huge telescopes on the ground as well as in space. These modern telescopes equipped with massive mirrors allow astronomers to capture the light of very faint and faraway objects. Specialized techniques and sensitive scientific instruments have been developed to study not only visible light, but also the entire electromagnetic spectrum of light including infrared light, radio waves and X-rays.</p><br>

<p>Large, complex telescopes and advanced techniques have even enabled astronomers to directly observe phenomena including black holes, distant exoplanets, and gravitational waves.</p><br>
<p>Thanks to the sheer size of its 6.5-metre-diametre golden mirror, the James Webb Space Telescope is the largest space telescope ever built. Set to launch in 2021, Webb will use its precision instruments to peer into clouds of cosmic dust to collect infrared light from distant stars and galaxies, giving Canadian astronomers a groundbreaking glimpse of the earliest moments of our universe and never-before-seen planets circling other stars. </p><br>
<p> Astronomy is the study of the sun, moon, stars, planets, comets, gas, galaxies, gas, dust and other non-Earthly bodies and phenomena. In curriculum for K-4 students, NASA defines astronomy as simple "the study of stars, planets and space." Astronomy and astrology were historically associated, but astrology is not a science and is no longer recognized as having anything to do with astronomy. Below we discuss the history of astronomy and related fields of study, including cosmology.</p>
<p>Observational astronomers focus on direct study of stars, planets, galaxies, and so forth while ,Theoretical astronomers model and analyze how systems may have evolved.</p>
<p>Galactic astronomers study our galaxy, the Milky Way, while extragalactic astronomers peer outside of it to determine how these collections of stars form, change, and die. The University of Wisconsin-Madison says, "Establishing patterns in the distribution, composition, and physical conditions of stars and gas traces the history of our evolving home galaxy and Cosmologists focus on the universe in its entirety, from its violent birth in the Big Bang to its present evolution, all the way to its eventual death. Astronomy is often (not always) about very concrete, observable things, whereas cosmology typically involves large-scale properties of the universe and esoteric, invisible and sometimes purely theoretical things like string theory, dark matter and dark energy, and the notion of multiple universes.</p>
<p>Astronomical observers rely on different wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum (from radio waves to visible light and on up to X-rays and gamma-rays) to study the wide span of objects in the universe. The first telescopes focused on simple optical studies of what could be seen with the naked eye, and many telescopes continue that today. [Celestial Photos: Hubble Space Telescope's Latest Cosmic Views] . But as light waves become more or less energetic, they move faster or slower. Different telescopes are necessary to study the various wavelengths. More energetic radiation, with shorter wavelengths, appears in the form of ultraviolet, X-ray, and gamma-ray wavelengths, while less energetic objects emit longer-wavelength infrared and radio waves.</p>
<p>Astrometry, the most ancient branch of astronomy, is the measure of the sun, moon and planets. The precise calculations of these motions allows astronomers in other fields to model the birth and evolution of planets and stars, and to predict events such as eclipses meteor showers, and the appearance of comets. According to the Planetary Society, "Astrometry is the oldest method used to detect extrasolar planets," though it remains a difficult process.</p>
<br>
Foundations of Modern Astronomy

<br>

<p>Nicolaus Copernicus and the Heliocentric hypothesis</p>

<br>
<p>Copernicus (1473–1547) was a Polish scholar who postulated an alternative description of the solar system. Like the Ptolemaic geocentric (“Earth‐centered”) model of the solar system, the Copernican heliocentric (“Sun‐centered”) model is an empirical model. That is, it has no theoretical basis, but simply reproduces the observed motions of objects in the sky.</p>

<br>

<p>In the heliocentric model, Copernicus assumed Earth rotated once a day to account for the daily rise and set of the Sun and stars. Otherwise the Sun was in the center with Earth and the five naked‐eye planets moving about it with uniform motion on circular orbits (deferents, like the geocentric model of Ptolemy), with the center of each offset slightly from Earth's position. The one exception to this model was that the Moon moved about Earth. Finally, in this model, the stars lay outside the planets so far away that no parallax could be observed.</p>

<br>

<p>Why did the Copernican model gain acceptance over the Ptolemaic model? The answer is not accuracy, because the Copernican model is actually no more accurate than the Ptolemaic model—both have errors of a few minutes of arc. The Copernican model is more attractive because the principles of geometry set the distance of the planets from the Sun. The greatest angular displacements for Mercury and Venus (the two planets that orbit closer to the Sun, the so‐called inferior planets) from the position of the Sun ( maximum elongation) yield right angle triangles that set their orbital sizes relative to Earth's orbital size. After the orbital period of an outer planet (a planet with an orbital size larger than the orbit of Earth is termed a superior planet) is known, the observed time for a planet to move from a position directly opposite the sun ( opposition) to a position 90 degrees from the Sun ( quadrature) also yields a right‐angle triangle, from which the orbital distance from the Sun can be found for the planet.</p>

<br>

<p>If the Sun is placed in the center, astronomers find that planetary orbital periods correlate with the distance from the Sun (as was assumed in the geocentric model of Ptolemy). But its greater simplicity does not prove the correctness of the heliocentric idea. And the fact that Earth is unique for having another object (the Moon) orbiting around it is a discordant feature.</p>

<br>


<p>Galileo Galilei and the invention of the telescope<br>


<p>Settling the debate between the geocentric versus heliocentric ideas required new information about the planets. Galileo did not invent the telescope but was one of the first people to point the new invention at the sky, and is certainly the one who made it famous. He discovered craters and mountains on the Moon, which challenged the old Aristotelian concept that celestial bodies are perfect spheres. On the Sun he saw dark spots that moved about it, proving that the Sun rotates. He observed that around Jupiter traveled four moons (the Galilean satellites Io, Europa, Callisto, and Ganymede), showing that Earth was not unique in having a satellite. His observation also revealed that the Milky Way is composed of myriads of stars. Most crucial, however, was Galileo's discovery of the changing pattern of the phases of Venus, which provided a clear‐cut test between predictions of the geocentric and heliocentric hypotheses, specifically showing that the planets must move about the Sun.</p>

<br>

<p>Johannes Kepler</p>
<br>

<p>Because the heliocentric concept of Copernicus was flawed, new data were required to correct its deficiencies. Tycho Brahe's (1546–1601) measurements of accurate positions of celestial objects provided for the first time a continuous and homogeneous record that could be used to mathematically determine the true nature of orbits. Johannes Kepler (1571–1630), who began his work as Tycho's assistant, performed the analysis of planetary orbits. His analysis resulted in Kepler's laws of planetary motion, which are as follows:</p>

<br>

The law of orbits: All planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus.


<br>
The law of areas: A line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal time.


<br>
The law of periods: The square of the period ( P) of any planet is proportional to the cube of the semi‐major axis ( r) of its orbit, or P 2G (M (sun) + M) = 4 π 2 r 3, where M is the mass of the planet.


<br>
Isaac Newton. Isaac Newton (1642–1727), in his 1687 work, Principia, placed physical understanding on a deeper level by deducing a law of gravity and three general laws of motion that apply to all objects:


<br>

Newton's first law of motion states that an object remains at rest or continues in a state of uniform motion if no external force acts upon the object.


<br>
Newton's second law of motion states that if a net force acts on an object, it will cause an acceleration of that object.


<br>
Newton's third law of motion states that for every force there is an equal and opposite force. Therefore, if one object exerts a force on a second object, the second exerts an equal and oppositely directed force on the first one.


<br>


Beyond Newton: Relativity Theories<br>


<p>Newton's Laws of Motion and Gravity are adequate for understanding many phenomena in the universe; but under exceptional circumstances, scientists must use more accurate and complex theories. These circumstances include relativistic conditions in which a) large velocities approaching the speed of light are involved (theory of special relativity), and/or b) where gravitational forces become extremely strong (theory of general relativity).</p>


<br>
<p>In simplest terms, according to the theory of general relativity, the presence of a mass (such as the Sun) causes a change in the geometry in the space around it. A two‐dimensional analogy would be a curved saucer. If a marble (representing a planet) is placed in the saucer, it moves about the curved rim in a path due to the saucer's curvature. Such a path, however, is the same as an orbit and nearly identical with the path that would be calculated by use of a Newtonian gravitational force to continually change the direction of motion. In the real universe, the difference between Newtonian and relativistic orbits is usually small, a difference of two centimeters for the Earth‐Moon orbital distance ( r = 384,000 km on average). </p>
